## Logging in Kubernetes

---

In this lab we will discuss possible logging architectures

---

### Logging at the node level

+++

Everything a containerized application writes to stdout and stderr is handled and redirected somewhere by a container engine

Docker container engine redirects those two streams to a logging driver, which is configured in Kubernetes to write to a file in json format

---

### Using a node logging agent

+++

- the logging agent is a dedicated tool that exposes logs or pushes logs to a backend
- Commonly, the logging agent is a container that has access to a directory with log files from all of the application containers on that node
- itâ€™s common to implement it as either a DaemonSet replica

---

### Using a sidecar container with the logging agent

+++

- The sidecar containers read logs from a file, a socket, or the journald
- Each individual sidecar container prints log to its own stdout or stderr stream

---

### Exposing logs directly from the application
