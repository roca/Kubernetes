### Connect to Jenkins

Now find the load balancer IP address of your Ingress service (in the `Address` field). **This field may take a few minutes to appear as the load balancer is being provisioned**:

```shell
$  kubectl get ingress --namespace jenkins
NAME      RULE      BACKEND            ADDRESS         AGE
jenkins      -         master:8080        130.X.X.X      4m
```

The loadbalancer will begin health checks against your Jenkins instance. Once the checks go to ```Unknown``` you will be able to access your Jenkins instance:
```shell
$  kubectl describe ingress jenkins --namespace jenkins
Name:			jenkins
Namespace:		jenkins
Address:		130.211.14.253
Default backend:	jenkins-ui:8080 (10.76.2.3:8080)

```

Open the load balancer's IP address in your web browser, click "Log in" in the top right and sign in with the default Jenkins username `jenkins` and the password you configured when deploying Jenkins. You can find the password in the `jenkins/k8s/options` file.

> **Note**: To further secure your instance follow the steps found [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Securing+Jenkins).

### Your progress, and what's next
You've got a Kubernetes cluster managed by Google Container Engine. You've deployed:

* a Jenkins Deployment
* a (non-public) service that exposes Jenkins to its slave containers
* an Ingress resource that routes to the Jenkins service

You have the tools to build a continuous deployment pipeline. Now you need a sample app to deploy continuously.
