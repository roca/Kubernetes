## A Google Cloud Platform Account
For this workshop, one will be provided for you.

## Enable Google Cloud Platform APIs 
[Enable the Google Compute Engine and Google Container Engine APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=compute_component,container)

## Setup Cloud Shell
In this section you will start your [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-shell/docs/) and clone the lab code repository to it.

1. Create a new Google Cloud Platform project: [https://console.developers.google.com/project](https://console.developers.google.com/project)

1. Click the Google Cloud Shell icon in the top-right and wait for your shell to open:

  ![](../docs/img/cloud-shell-prompt.png)

1. When the shell is open, set your default compute zone:

  ```shell
  $ gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-d
  ```

1. Clone the lab repository in your cloud shell, then `cd` into that dir:

  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/askcarter/continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes.git
  Cloning into 'continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes'...
  ...

  $ cd continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes
  ```


## Create a Kubernetes Cluster
You'll use Google Container Engine to create and manage your Kubernetes cluster. Provision the cluster with `gcloud`:

```shell
$ gcloud container clusters create jenkins-cd \
  --num-nodes 3 \
  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,storage-rw"
```

Once that operation completes download the credentials for your cluster using the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/):
```shell
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials jenkins-cd
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for jenkins-cd.
```

Confirm that the cluster is running and `kubectl` is working by listing pods:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
```
You should see an empty response.
