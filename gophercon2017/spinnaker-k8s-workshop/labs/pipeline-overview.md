## App Explanation

## The sample app
You'll use a very simple sample application - `gceme` - as the basis for your CD pipeline. `gceme` is written in Go and is located in the `sample-app` directory in this repo. When you run the `gceme` binary on a GCE instance, it displays the instance's metadata in a pretty card:

The binary supports two modes of operation, designed to mimic a microservice. In backend mode, `gceme` will listen on a port (8080 by default) and return GCE instance metadata as JSON, with content-type=application/json. In frontend mode, `gceme` will query a backend `gceme` service and render that JSON in the UI you saw above. It looks roughly like this:

```
-----------      ------------      ~~~~~~~~~~~~        -----------
|         |      |          |      |          |        |         |

-----------      ------------      ~~~~~~~~~~~~   |    -----------
                                                  |    -----------
                                                  |    |         |
                                                  |--> |  gceme  |
                                                       |(backend)|
                                                       |         |
                                                       -----------
```
Both the frontend and backend modes of the application support two additional URLs:

1. `/version` prints the version of the binary (declared as a const in `main.go`)
1. `/healthz` reports the health of the application. In frontend mode, health will be OK if the backend is reachable.
