# Kubernetes Training and Cookbook

This repository contains instructions and examples for the O'Reilly Live Online Training for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
Dates are listed in the [O'Reilly Live Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/) training schedule.

It also contains [examples and scripts](./cookbook) used in the Kubernetes [Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920064947.do).

## Prerequisites

In this training we will use [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) to run a local Kubernetes instance. We will access this local Kubernetes with the client called `kubectl`.

* Install [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases)
* Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)

Verify your installation:

```
$ minikube version
minikube version: v0.16.0

$ minikube start

$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"5", GitVersion:"v1.5.2", GitCommit:"08e099554f3c31f6e6f07b448ab3ed78d0520507", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-01-12T04:57:25Z", GoVersion:"go1.7.4", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"5", GitVersion:"v1.5.2", GitCommit:"08e099554f3c31f6e6f07b448ab3ed78d0520507", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", GoVersion:"go1.7.1", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

If you are impatient, you can now start playing with Kubernetes:

* Create a deployment with `kubectl run ghost --image=ghost`
* Do you see a running _Pod_ : `kubectl get pods`
* Check `kubectl --help` what can you do ?

## Code of Conduct

Since this is an official O'Reilly Training, we will adhere to the [O'Reilly conferences Code of Conduct](http://www.oreilly.com/conferences/code-of-conduct.html).

_"At O'Reilly, we assume that most people are intelligent and well-intended, and we're not inclined to tell people what to do. However, we want every O'Reilly conference to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct spells out the behavior we support and don't support at conferences."_
